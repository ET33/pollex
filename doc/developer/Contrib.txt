    Straight to the point directions.

    * Make changes:

       a) edit, remove and add files in source directory (src);
       b) update Makefile and Dockerfile accordingly;
       c) build RPS image and start a new instance;
       d) test it locally using a web browser.

       By default, development version listens to port 8080; you may
       override defaults using Make's command line arguments.

       Refer to Makefile for available rules and options.


    * Build the image: 

      	    src/$ make

      The image will be rebuilt on any dependency change.

    * Bring up the container:

      	    src/$ make start

      This will automatically (re)build the image.

    * Shut down the container:

      	    src/$ make stop

      This won't remove the image.

    * Wipe off both the container and the image:

      	   src/$ make cleanup

    * Log into a running container and get a bash prompt

           src/$ make login

      Log out by issuing 'exit' at bash prompt
